# Week 2 - Research: Building a Stronger Business Case

## 🔍 Overview

This week’s focus is on strengthening a project’s business case using strategies such as A/B testing, use case validation, and analytics. These approaches help validate user needs, uncover pain points, and make sure the app delivers measurable value.

## ✅ Insights from Resources

### 1. **Google Case Studies: The Story Behind Success**

Google projects often began with internal testing and grew based on user feedback. For example, Gmail and Maps became successful because they solved real problems and scaled through data-informed iteration.

➡️ **IOM Application**: Before fully building out complex OctoPrint controls, I can release a basic version to a small tester group. Their feedback will guide improvements before a full launch.

---

### 2. **A/B Testing**

A/B testing compares two feature versions to see which performs better. It’s most valuable when tied to clear user actions like file uploads or page completions.

➡️ **IOM Application**: I will test two upload interfaces — one minimalist, one feature-rich — to learn which results in better user flow and satisfaction.

---

### 3. **Use Case Testing**

Use cases outline what the user does and what they expect the system to do in response. Testing against them validates both logic and usability.

➡️ **Example Use Case for IOM**  
**Title**: Upload and Print a Model  
**Actor**: Authenticated User  
**Steps**: Log in → Upload `.gcode` → Select printer → Click "Print"  
**Expected Result**: File appears in queue and user receives confirmation.

### 4. **Agile Planning (from "Your First Plan")**

Agile planning breaks down large goals into small, testable tasks (issues/stories) that can be refined through iteration.

➡️ **IOM Application**: I’m organizing tasks like “upload logic,” “file preview,” and “OctoPrint API check” as individual issues on the board, making it easier to review and test during sprints.

## 🧠 Conclusion

This week’s research clarified how to validate and improve IOM before beta release. I’ll apply:

- ✅ A/B testing on upload UI
- ✅ Use case validation for user actions
- ✅ Analytics to track key user interactions

These tools and strategies help ensure that IOM is usable, scalable, and aligned with user needs before wider release.
