## Topic - Usability and Design Theory in UI/UX

This document contains research notes on applying usability principles, UI/UX best practices, and design theory to **Icepik's Octo Manager (IOM)**.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 1 - Usability Principles

Brief overview of research: Usability refers to how efficiently, effectively, and satisfyingly a product allows users to achieve their goals. It is evaluated using five core principles: learnability, efficiency, memorability, error prevention, and satisfaction.

- **Key Finding 1**: Learnability ensures that new users can quickly understand and interact with the interface.

  - **Application**: IOM will include a dashboard layout with labeled icons for primary actions like "Upload G-code" and "File Library." An onboarding pop-up will guide first-time users.

- **Key Finding 2**: Efficiency is how quickly tasks can be performed after initial learning.

  - **Application**: IOM will feature a drag-and-drop upload zone, persistent navigation, and pre-filled forms to save user time.

- **Key Finding 3**: Memorability helps returning users re-establish proficiency.

  - **Application**: IOM will use consistent navigation patterns (e.g., tabs, breadcrumbs) and include tooltips and a Help/FAQ section for reorientation.

- **Key Finding 4**: Error prevention reduces the frequency and severity of user errors.

  - **Application**: File validation will ensure only `.gcode` files are accepted. Errors will display with clear messages, and confirmation dialogs will prevent accidental critical actions.

- **Key Finding 5**: Satisfaction ensures users enjoy interacting with the product.
  - **Application**: IOM will feature a modern teal/gray color scheme, subtle animations, and success messages to enhance user experience.

## Sub-Topic 2 - UI and UX Principles

Brief overview of research: UI focuses on visual design and layout, while UX centers on user interaction and satisfaction. Together, they ensure an intuitive and efficient product.

- **Key Finding 1**: Visibility ensures that users can see all important features clearly.

  - **Application**: IOM will prominently display the "Upload" and "File Library" options on the dashboard.

- **Key Finding 2**: Feedback provides users with responses to their actions.

  - **Application**: IOM will display success messages for uploads and warnings for errors, such as unsupported file types.

- **Key Finding 3**: Constraints limit user actions to prevent errors or confusion.

  - **Application**: Actions like "Start Print" will be disabled for offline printers, and file uploads will validate against incorrect formats.

- **Key Finding 4**: Consistency ensures the interface behaves uniformly across pages.

  - **Application**: IOM will use the same header, footer, and navigation design on all pages.

- **Key Finding 5**: Accessibility makes the app usable for all users, including those with disabilities.
  - **Application**: IOM will follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines, ensuring readable font sizes, sufficient color contrast, and keyboard navigation.

## Sub-Topic 3 - Design Theory

Brief overview of research: Design theory emphasizes creating functional, aesthetic, and user-centered interfaces. It integrates elements like tone, structure, and whitespace to optimize user experience.

- **Key Finding 1**: Avoid confirmshaming to maintain user trust.

  - **Application**: IOM will use neutral and professional language in dialogs, such as “Are you sure you want to delete this file?”

- **Key Finding 2**: Apply UX Laws like Hick’s Law and Fitts’s Law to improve usability.

  - **Application**: IOM will simplify choices in navigation (e.g., Dashboard, Upload, LIVE!), and place key actions like "Upload" prominently for easy access.

- **Key Finding 3**: Eliminate common design mistakes like cluttered layouts or vague CTAs.

  - **Application**: IOM will use consistent typography (Poppins for headers, Roboto for body text) and clear CTAs like “Start Print.”

- **Key Finding 4**: Design dialogs to be clear, concise, and actionable.

  - **Application**: IOM dialogs will have clear titles, action buttons (e.g., "Delete" and "Cancel"), and relevant context.

- **Key Finding 5**: Use whitespace effectively to create focus and readability.
  - **Application**: IOM will add spacing between navigation items and ensure content cards (e.g., in the File Library) have padding for clarity.
