### **Sub-Topic 1 - Usability Principles**

Brief overview of research: Usability refers to how efficiently, effectively, and satisfyingly a product allows users to achieve their goals. It is evaluated using five core principles: learnability, efficiency, memorability, error prevention, and satisfaction.

### **Sub-Topic 4 - Plans for Production**

#### **API Design**

- **Key Finding 1**: Follow RESTful principles for clarity and simplicity.
- **Key Finding 2**: Use consistent URL structures (e.g., `/users`, `/files`) and HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`).
- **Key Finding 3**: Include robust validation and error handling to ensure data integrity.

#### **Atomic Design**

- **Key Finding 1**: Break down UI into reusable components.
- **Key Finding 2**: Components are categorized as:
  - **Atoms**: Smallest UI elements like buttons, labels, and inputs.
  - **Molecules**: Groups of atoms forming a unit, such as a search bar.
  - **Organisms**: Larger UI structures, such as a dashboard or navigation bar.
- **Key Finding 3**: Atomic design ensures consistency and reusability.

#### **Component Breakdown**

- **Key Finding 1**: Identify reusable components (e.g., drag-and-drop file uploader, subscription selector).
- **Key Finding 2**: Define the dynamic and static elements for each component.
- **Key Finding 3**: Components must scale efficiently for future updates.
