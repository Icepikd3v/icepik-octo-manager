# Week 1 Research - Project Kickoff

## 🔍 Project Scope

Icepik’s Octo Manager (IOM) is a web application designed to manage 3D printers using the OctoPrint API. The primary goal is to allow users to upload files, monitor live print jobs, and manage prints from a browser. The frontend is built with React using Create React App, and a backend using Express and Sequelize is planned for next milestone. Scope remains unchanged from the WDV349 proposal.

## 💡 Key Takeaways from Research

- **Startup Idea Evaluation**: Based on Y Combinator’s guidance, IOM solves a real problem for 3D printing enthusiasts who want remote access and simplified printer management.
- **Kickoff Questions**: Clear on who the app is for (makers, hobbyists, tech enthusiasts) and the core value (remote file upload, monitoring, queue management).
- **30-Second Pitch**:
  > _"Icepik’s Octo Manager is a web app for 3D printing enthusiasts that connects to your OctoPrint-enabled printer, lets you upload and manage files remotely, and streamlines your workflow whether you're home or away."_
