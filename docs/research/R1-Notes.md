## Topic - Feature Branch Workflow

This document contains general notes related to the feature branch workflow, which is used to manage code contributions in a structured and collaborative manner.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 1 - Creating and Managing Branches

Brief overview of research: Branching allows developers to work on features or fixes independently before integrating them into the main codebase.

- Key finding 1: Use the `git branch <branch-name>` command to create a new branch.
- Key finding 2: Switch branches using `git checkout <branch-name>` or `git switch <branch-name>`.
- Key finding 3: Regularly pull updates from the main branch to avoid conflicts.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 2 - Merging and Pull Requests

Brief overview of research: Merging integrates changes from one branch to another, and pull requests formalize this process for review.

- Key finding 1: Use `git merge <branch-name>` to merge locally.
- Key finding 2: Pull requests (PRs) are used to merge branches via GitHub, allowing team members to review changes.
- Key finding 3: Resolve conflicts during merges by editing conflicting files and committing the resolved version.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 3 - Best Practices for Branch Workflows

Brief overview of research: Adopting best practices ensures smooth collaboration and fewer integration issues.

- Key finding 1: Name branches descriptively (e.g., `feature-login` or `bugfix-issue123`).
- Key finding 2: Commit often with clear messages to document progress.
- Key finding 3: Always review and test code changes before merging.
