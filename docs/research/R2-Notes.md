## Topic - Wireframes and Structure

This document contains general notes related to wireframing and the overall structure of user interfaces, with a focus on best practices, tools, and techniques for application design.

<br>

## Sub-Topic 1 - Importance of Wireframing

Brief overview of research: Wireframing helps visualize the structure and functionality of an application before development begins.

- **Key finding 1**: Wireframes clarify the layout, user flow, and feature placement.
- **Key finding 2**: Low-fidelity wireframes focus on structure, while high-fidelity wireframes include visual details like fonts, colors, and icons.
- **Key finding 3**: Wireframes help stakeholders and developers align expectations early in the project lifecycle.

## Sub-Topic 2 - Best Practices for Wireframing

Brief overview of research: Following best practices ensures wireframes are clear, usable, and aligned with the application’s purpose.

- **Key finding 1**: Keep wireframes simple and avoid unnecessary details at the early stages.
- **Key finding 2**: Use a consistent layout, grid system, and visual hierarchy to enhance readability.
- **Key finding 3**: Annotate wireframes to explain key interactions or design decisions.

## Sub-Topic 3 - Tools for Wireframing

Brief overview of research: Modern tools streamline the wireframing process, making it easier to design, iterate, and share.

- **Key finding 1**: Figma is ideal for creating digital, interactive wireframes and supports collaboration.
- **Key finding 2**: Sketch is popular for macOS users and integrates well with other design tools.
- **Key finding 3**: Pen-and-paper sketches are a quick way to ideate and plan layouts before moving to digital tools.

## Sub-Topic 4 - Structure and User Flow

Brief overview of research: Defining a clear structure and user flow helps users navigate the application efficiently.

- **Key finding 1**: Organize content hierarchically, with primary sections (e.g., homepage, dashboard) leading to secondary content.
- **Key finding 2**: Use user personas and scenarios to map out user journeys and identify key touchpoints.
- **Key finding 3**: Focus on accessibility and responsive design to ensure usability across devices.
