## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week  
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them  
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week  
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1 - Milestone 1

⚙️ **Overview:**  
This week, I worked on:

- Researching feature branch workflows and documenting findings in `R1-Notes.md`.
- Defining the tech stack for the project and updating `TechStack.md`.
- Drafting the project proposal in `ProjectProposal.md`.
- Managing and resolving GitHub issues for Milestone 1.
- Setting up the stage branch and leaving the pull request from `dev` to `stage` open for tracking.

🌵 **Challenges:**

- Understanding the Git feature branch workflow and resolving conflicts during pull requests.
- Determining the best way to integrate my personal branding into the project name.

🏆 **Accomplishments:**

- Successfully named the project **Icepik's Octo Manager (IOM)**.
- Completed all required tasks for Milestone 1 and updated related issues on the project board.

🔮 **Next Steps:**

- Finalize the pull request from `dev` to `stage` after confirming all milestone tasks are complete.
- Begin work on Milestone 2, focusing on initial design and wireframes for the application.

### Week 2- Milestone 2

**Overview:**
This week, I worked on:

- Designing wireframes for all key application pages, including Homepage, User Dashboard, LIVE!, Upload, and File Library.
- Developing the style tile to define the branding elements (colors, typography, icons, and UI components).
- Exporting and organizing wireframes and the style tile in the `docs` folder.
- Managing GitHub workflow by creating the `wireframes` branch and pushing all deliverables.

🌵 Challenges:

- Ensuring consistency across all wireframes while maintaining a balance between modern professionalism and playful accessibility.
- Selecting complementary fonts that align with the project's branding and purpose.
- Deciding whether to combine wireframes and the style tile into one branch or separate branches.

🏆 Accomplishments:

- Successfully completed and exported all wireframes and the style tile.
- Pushed deliverables to the `wireframes` branch and prepared them for merging into `dev`.
- Finalized branding decisions, including fonts, color schemes, and logo design.

🔮 Next Steps:

- Merge the `wireframes` branch into `dev` after reviewing the pull request.
- Close Milestone 2 and ensure all issues are resolved.
- Begin preparing for Milestone 3, focusing on refining designs and initial development tasks.

### Week 3 - Milestone 3

⚙️ **Overview:**  
This week, I worked on:

- Refining the clickable prototype for **Icepik's Octo Manager (IOM)**, including all navigation actions and interactions.
- Conducting research on usability principles, design theory, and production planning, updating `R3-Notes.md` with findings.
- Creating standalone GitHub issues for models, state management, and routes.
- Managing GitHub workflow by merging the `Prototype` branch into `dev` after resolving merge conflicts.
- Exporting wireframe designs and organizing them in the `docs/designs` folder.

🌵 **Challenges:**

- **Navigation in Figma**: Initially struggled with linking prototype actions, particularly for drag-and-drop interactions. Resolved this by focusing on live feedback within the upload area.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Encountered a merge conflict with `R3-Notes.md` while merging the `Prototype` branch into `dev`. Successfully resolved by integrating changes from both branches.

🏆 **Accomplishments:**

- Completed a fully functional clickable prototype with all navigation actions.
- Successfully updated `R3-Notes.md` with detailed research notes on usability, design theory, and production planning.
- Created standalone issues for key elements like models, state management, and routes.
- Organized all exported wireframes and designs in the `docs/designs` folder.

🔮 **Next Steps:**

- Finalize the pull request from `dev` to `stage` for Milestone 3 submission.
- Prepare for Week 4 by starting work on backend implementation, including API design and state management planning.
