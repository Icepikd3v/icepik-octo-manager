## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week  
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them  
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week  
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1 - Milestone 1

⚙️ **Overview:**  
This week, I worked on:

- Researching feature branch workflows and documenting findings in `R1-Notes.md`.
- Defining the tech stack for the project and updating `TechStack.md`.
- Drafting the project proposal in `ProjectProposal.md`.
- Managing and resolving GitHub issues for Milestone 1.
- Setting up the stage branch and leaving the pull request from `dev` to `stage` open for tracking.

🌵 **Challenges:**

- Understanding the Git feature branch workflow and resolving conflicts during pull requests.
- Determining the best way to integrate my personal branding into the project name.

🏆 **Accomplishments:**

- Successfully named the project **Icepik's Octo Manager (IOM)**.
- Completed all required tasks for Milestone 1 and updated related issues on the project board.

🔮 **Next Steps:**
