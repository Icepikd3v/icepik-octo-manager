# Tech Stack

## Application Design

I propose using **Figma** for creating click-through designs of the application. Figma is a versatile tool that enables collaboration and provides a wide range of UI kits, which can speed up the design process. For additional design elements, I plan to use the **Material Design UI kit** to ensure a clean and consistent user interface.

## Front End Framework

For front-end development, I will use **React.js** due to its component-based architecture, which allows for reusable and modular code. To style the application, I propose using **CSS Modules** for scoped styling and ensuring maintainability. I will also include **ESLint** to enforce coding standards and **PropTypes** to validate component props.

## State Management

I plan to use **Redux** as the state management solution. Redux is ideal for handling complex application states and ensures predictable state changes. Additionally, it integrates well with React, allowing for a seamless development process. For non-persistent data, I will use the **Context API** in smaller, isolated components.

## Node

For the back-end, I will use **Node.js** to serve the API and handle server-side rendering if needed. Node.js is a scalable solution and supports modern JavaScript, making it easier to maintain consistency across the application stack. I will use **npm** to manage dependencies and **npx** for running Node-related commands efficiently.

## Express

To power the API, I will use **Express.js**, a lightweight framework known for its flexibility and ease of use. I will structure the application using:

- **Middleware**: For request validation, authentication, and logging.
- **Routes**: To define endpoints for all CRUD operations.
- **Controllers**: For handling API logic and interacting with the database.
  The API will send and receive **JSON data** to ensure compatibility with the front end.

## SQL/Postgres/Sequelize

For the database, I will use **PostgreSQL** with **Sequelize** as the ORM. Sequelize simplifies database interactions by providing an abstraction for writing queries, managing migrations, and seeding data. The application will include:

- **Validated Models**: For entities like Users, Products, and Orders.
- **CRUD Operations**: To create, read, update, and delete data.
- **Migrations and Seed Data**: To manage database structure and populate initial data.
  This approach ensures a robust and maintainable relational database layer.
